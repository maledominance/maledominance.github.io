    <p>What is male dominance? Some would say that it is using your physical power to overcome and take control over the people in the room. Other would say that it is using your mental power to manipulate the people in the room. But actually a mix of both. Male dominance is basically where a man uses his mental and physical power to rule over rule over or dominate the environment that he is in. Most of the time the male will use all his power to overpower the women but the male will also try to overpower everyone and thing in the room 

Where is male dominance seen and used the most.  Everyone has there own opinion as to where it is used and seen. According to the New York times you are more likely to encounter male dominance at places like work on mainstream law enforcement and  etc. why though why would see more males dominating these
 Places.

      <p><i>A Natural Slave or Born to Rule? : Male Dominance</i></p>
      <p>
A good example of supremacy is the adult and the kid. This is shown by constant respect and obedience. There are 2 different personalities; submissive and dominant. When the kid becomes an adolescent, he/she either constantly challenges the authority or doesnâ€™t and gives in. This is not only a sign of growing but also a sign of maturity. 

Dominance is represented by having complete control of your adversary or opponent. It is represented in many ways. Men have issues growing up because they are forced to learn and are brainwashed to have constant power and influence over others. Bullying is a growing issue and relates quite a bit to the dominance in one over the other.

 It does not necessarily have to do with only men, but it's definitely the command of one over another. You can clearly see this because a study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice states that 64% of students who are bullied do not report it (Petrosina, Guckenburg, Devoe and Hanson 2010).</p>

    <p><strong>Effects Of Male Dominance </strong>In my eyes I see male dominance both as a positive and negative effect in our society. Male dominance is no longer necessary for survival or the contribution in our society, it now depends on how a male is raised in their own household, the amount of access they have to the media and own social circle. This is also what shapes them into what they might later become as a man. Most males do feel dominant but in differents ways, some are raised in a good manner where they have the most responsibility in a household and act as a leader. Men feel dominant because they have a type of control that makes them feel good and continue to be a leader.
